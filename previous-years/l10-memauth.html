<p>
<b>Model (assumptions, security requirements, possible attacks):</b>

</p><p>
	What is memory authentication? The ability to verify that the data
	read from memory by the processor at a given address is the data
	it last wrote at this address.

</p><p>
	Why memory authentication? An adversary able to corrupt the
	memory space can affect the computations performed by a trusted
	computing platform. Assumptions: Too costly to provide a tamper
	evident environment that includes memory. The trusted computing
	platform is a single chip secure processor with limited on-chip
	storage. It is resistant to all physical attacks, including
	invasive ones. Whenever a sensitive computation is finalized,
	the authenticity of the sequence of off-chip memory operations
	during the computation needs to be verified. Notice that,
	depending on the application, this happens all the time, or
	sometimes. This leads to different authentication strategies
	(tree based or not tree based).

</p><p>
	Is it realistic to have a single chip processor which is
	resistant to all physical attacks? It may be acceptable to
	be only resistant to all physical attacks that cost not too
	much. This excludes attacks performed by the common hacker. We
	do not try to protect against attacks performed by engineers
	with access to expensive laboratories. The required security
	(and its costs) is part of a business model.

</p><p>
	Data integrity refers to the ability to detect any adversarial
	corruption or tampering of data. What is its relation to memory
	authentication? Memory authentication implies data integrity.

</p><p>
	The objective of memory authentication is to thwart active
	attacks that tamper with off-chip memory contents. What are
	these active attacks? Spoofing: existing memory block is
	exchanged with an arbitrary fake one. Splicing/Relocation:
	replace a memory block at address A with a block at address
	B. Replay: a memory block located at a given address is
	recorded and inserted at the same address at a later point
	in time.

</p><p>
	What is a software attack? A software attack is an
	active attack performed by a compromised OS or malicious
	application. We cannot trust the OS, even if the OS kernel
	is designed to isolate sensitive applications from malicious
	software. For now, we will not consider software attacks.

</p><p>
	What other security requirements are of interest? Access
	control; applications should not be able to access one
	another's application specific data. Data confidentiality;
	encrypt sensitive data to ensure privacy.

</p><p>
	Why are these requirements not sufficient? An attacker
	may manipulate encrypted data. So, we also need memory
	authentication.

</p><p>
	Does encryption of sensitive data really ensure privacy? What
	about correlating memory access patterns? This may leak
	information about the nature of the application and to which
	other applications, with which it shares memory, it is related.

</p><p>
<b>Solutions (tree based solutions and a non-tree based solution):</b>

</p><p>
	What is a naive solution for memory authentication? Store
	digest of entire memory in on-chip storage. Unacceptable.

</p><p>
	What is a next best solution? Store a digest of every memory
	block (cache block), see Figure 3(a). Reduces memory bandwidth
	overhead, but needs too much (expensive) on-chip memory.

</p><p>
	What is a slightly better solution? Using nonces costs less
	on-chip memory, see Figure 3(b). If the nonce generator runs
	out of range, need to reset key k and update all memory (this
	can be done in idle time). Does the nonce generator need to
	output unique nonces, do nonces for different addresses need to
	be different? No, if we compute each MAC as a function of the
	key k, nonce N, and address A. So, we can use smaller nonces,
	leading to less on-chip storage. When a smaller nonce specific
	to a certain address runs out of range, this address cannot
	be used until key k is reset. If we use smaller nonces of say
	16 bits, can we use random nonces? No, with probability 1/
	2^16 this leads to a collision and possibly to an attack. We
	need deterministic nonces: for each update, just increment
	the corresponding nonce by 1.

</p><p>
	How can we add data confidentiality? Replace MAC by an
	encryption E, see Figure 3(c).

</p><p>
	What trick improves the current solutions? Integrity trees
	with Hash (Merkle tree), MAC + nonces, or E + nonces. See
	Figure 5. How does it work? Merkle tree update procedure is
	sequential: computation of a new hash node in a branch must
	be completed before the update of the next branch node can
	start. The PAT read and update procedures are parallelizable,
	how does this work? An intermediate node stores the MAC of
	the nonces stored in its children and these are all known
	beforehand. An intermediate node does not store the MAC
	of the MACs stored in its children (does would be similar
	to the Merkle tree). The TEC-Tree uses encryption, and
	does not store nonces. How are nonces retrieved during an
	update? Use decryption. Is a mixture of reads and updates
	parallelizable? No.

</p><p>
	How do we find the address of a parent node? Use tree
	traversal, which leads to (eq. 1).

</p><p>
	How can we make use of the cache to improve performance? Tree
	read and update procedures are terminated as soon as a cached
	hash or the root is encountered.

</p><p>
	What is a Bonsai Merkle Tree? Use many smaller trees using
	counters/nonces. Store their roots. Protect the counters
	using a special tree and store its intermediate nodes and
	leaves. See Figure 6. Notice the statement "a full page
	needs to be cryptographically processed every time a local
	counter rolls over". Don't worry about the details of
	this method. Just notice the similarity to our discussion of
	the solution presented in Figure 3(b).

</p><p>
	What do we need to do if the OS cannot be trusted? Build
	an integrity tree which covers only pages belonging to the
	application and which can only be updated when the application
	itself is running. Page table maps a page's virtual address
	to its physical address. Branch splicing attack corrupts
	the physical address corresponding to the virtual address
	of a given memory block, see Figure 7. Therefore, we need
	to build a tree over the virtual address space. The virtual
	address generated by the protected application is used to
	traverse the tree. What are the shortcomings? Not scalable:
	need a large memory capacity (allocation of physical page
	frames for the 2^64 bytes of leaf nodes that are defined
	during initialization, as well as allocation of memory for
	the non-leaf tree nodes) and a large initialization overhead
	(takes too much time to initialize such a tree). We also
	require one full-blown tree for each application requiring
	protection, rather than a single tree protecting all software
	in physical memory. How can we try to partially overcome
	these problems? Introduce a new hardware unit that builds an
	integrity tree over a reduced address space, which contains
	only those pages needed for the application's execution
	(it grows dynamically as the application memory footprint
	increases).

</p><p>
	Memory authentication without a tree structure: Lhash is
	designed for applications requiring integrity checking after
	a sequence of memory operations (as opposed to checking every
	memory operation as in tree schemes). It uses a multiset
	hash function to maintain at runtime a write and read log of
	memory locations, called WriteHash and ReadHash. These logs are
	stored on-chip. At initialization WriteHash is computed over
	the memory chunks belonging to the memory region that needs
	to be authenticated. WriteHash is updated at runtime when an
	off-chip write is performed or when a dirty cache block is
	evicted from cache. WriteHash reflects the off-chip memory
	state at any time. ReadHash is updated whenever an off-chip
	read is performed or a chunk is brought in cache. To check
	the integrity of a sequence of operations, all the blocks
	belonging to the memory region that are not present in cache
	are read, after which the ReadHash should equal the WriteHash.

</p><p>
	Requirements of multiset hash functions: compression
	(guarantees that we can store hashes in a small bounded amount
	of memory), comparability (a probabilistic algorithm that
	compares hashes, needed since a multiset not always hashes to
	the same value), incrementality (adding hashes of multisets
	together results in a hash of the union of the multisets),
	and multiset collision resistance (computationally infeasible
	to find two distinct multisets that hash to comparable hashes).

	need to consider bus transaction authentication on cache
	to cache transfers required in cache coherency protocols,
	see Figure 8.

	Related topics: How can we use an untrusted server to provide
	trusted storage for a large number of directories, where the
	files in each directory may be accessed and updated by several
	different devices that may be offline at different times and
	may not be able to communicate with each other except through
	an untrusted server (over an untrusted network). The multi-user
	network file system SUNDR offers protection against forking
	attacks, a form of attack where a server uses a replay attack
	to give different users a different view of the current state
	of the system. However, it does not <i>immediately</i> detect
	forking attacks. Instead, it offers <i>fork consistency</i>,
	which essentially ensures that the system server either behaves
	correctly, or that its failure or malicious behavior will be
	detected at a later moment when users are able to communicate
	with each other (for example, once a day during night time).
	If the untrusted server has a time-stamping device that can
	be trusted (for example, by using an embedded Trusted Platform
	Module), then immediate detection of forking and replay attacks
	is possible.

	Related topics: Cloud storage. A client wants to make sure
	that a replica of their data exists. A proof of retrievability
	(POF) is a short message generated by a server that contains
	evidence that a correct version of the client's data is
	stored at the server. This gives the possibility for clients
	to efficiently check that their data is sufficiently backed up
	(check out the latest news on the loss of T-mobile data!).

</p><p>
	Related topics: Sparse memory. By using an authenticated search
	tree, a proof of non-existence of a leaf that corresponds to
	an encrypted address can be generated. This protects against
	denial of existence of stored values (required for sparse
	memory), replay attacks, and unauthorized access.
